# Control-Engineering
Performed in March-April 2023. Some experiments done in a group as a part of the EE208 Lab Course based on a Horizontal Crane-Trolley system.

Experiment 8 deals with stability analysis of a Crane-Trolley system using Lyapunovâ€™s Indirect Method.

Experiment 10 involves dynamic studies of the system with a state-space model created in Simulink.

Experiment 11 is about the design of a control law for the system based on Lyapunov functions and Feedback linearization, with simulations performed in Simulink.
